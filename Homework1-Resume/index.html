					   <h3>Dr. Who</h3>
					   <h4>Personal Chef</h4>
					   <p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0">Dr. Who Website</a></p>
					   <p>June 2017</p>
					   <p>For a man who could never find time to eat, being Dr. Who's personal chef was a very rewarding experience.  Traveling the universe and staying in the tardis the whole time had its perks.  Whenever substanance was required, I used my superpower of touching any food image (magazine, book, webpage) and readily prepared food at the perfect temperature would magically appear.</p>

				   		<h3>KettleBell Madness</h3>
				   		<h4>Aspiring Kettlebell Competitor</h4>
					   	<p><a href="http://
					   www.rng.com">River North Gym</a></p>
					    <p>January 2017</p>
						<p>Day in day out I had the opportunity to swing pink, blue, yellow kettlebells. Occasionally I got an opportunity to work with a personal trainer whos favorite line was "how does that feel?" before adding more weight.  Personally, I prefer to do this by binge watching Netflix and eating popcorn all day.  I feel I am strongly suited for transitioning my current career into a movie critic role. </p>
